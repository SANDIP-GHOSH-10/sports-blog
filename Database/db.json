Meanwhile in Rajkot, India pacer Mohammed Shami had an injury scare during Bengal's Group A match against Madhya Pradesh at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium.However, more than anything else, it was Shami's close shave that made headlines in the match. While bowling the penultimate over of the MP innings, Shami fell in a bid to stop the ball and seemed to have got hit on his boots.The pacer, coming back from a long injury layoff, looked uncomfortable and held his lower back while lying on the ground.Nitin Patel, head of the Centre of Excellence's medical panel and who was being flown in to track Shami, promptly entered the field to check on the bowler.

      "title": "Sachin Tendulkar Wasn't A Big Name Ex-Australia Cricketer-Turned-Lawyer Who Got Him Out In 1991/92 PM's XI Game",
      "description": "Arguably the greatest batsman of all time, Sachin Tendulkar amassed nearly 16,000 Test runs in a glittering career. Tendulkar is also the highest scorer among Indian batters in Australia. However, when an 18-year old Sachin Tendulkar toured Australia in the summer of 1991/92, he wasn't so popular. On the eve of India's warm-up match against the Prime Minister's XI, Greg Rowell, an Australian lawyer who used to be a first-class cricketer, has narrated a heartwarming story of how he got Tendulkar out in the same game 23 years ago.Rowell had dismissed not only Tendulkar, but also Ravi Shastri in the 'Prime Minister's XI vs India' game in 1991. The latter was a renowned all-rounder at that time. A fast bowler, Rowell ended the game with stunning figures of 7/27. Sachin Tendulkar wasn't such a big name then; Ravi Shastri was, said Rowell, in a conversation with The Indian Express. Oh, by the end of the series though, I would know who Tendulkar really was, Rowell added. That was because Tendulkar had made a serious mark on Australian soil even at the age of 18. Although Australia had demolished India 4-0 in the five-match Test series, Sachin Tendulkar had shone bright. Tendulkar had finished the series as India's highest run-scorer. The 18-year-old slammed 368 runs in five Tests, including two centuries. Interestingly, Shastri also performed well in the series, scoring 300 runs in just three games, and finishing as India's second-highest run-scorer. Rowell had been part of a Prime Minister's XI that included several future Australia greats and regulars. The likes of Shane Warne, Matthew Hayden, Michael Bevan, Damien Fleming and Damien Martyn were all Rowell's teammates in that game. Allan Border had captained the side. It was televised nationally, and for us first-class players, it was a game where the country saw and judged you, revealed Rowell. Rowell made it as far as Australia A, playing against the senior Australia side, but failed to carve out a long career in professional cricket. Rowell switched professions, becoming a lawyer, before eventually winding up as a board member of Cricket Australia.",

Coetzee bowled in the morning session of the Durban Test on Saturday beginning proceedings with Kagiso Rabada but stopped after a threeover spell His second spell of the morning was off just two overs as Dhananjaya de Silva and Dinesh Chandimal staged a spirited fightback for Sri Lanka after they had started the day five down and looking at a bigger defeat than they eventually suffered Coetzee didnt bowl again after that in the session but did bowl three overs after lunch sending back Chandimal caught and bowled.Shukri Conrad the South Africa coach said after the days play that Coetzee had spoken to him at lunch and told him he felt a groin niggle and went back after the break strapped up.Coetzees absence adds to South Africas injury woes as they are already without Wiaan Mulder the fastbowling allrounder due to a fractured right middle finger .Two of South Africas three quicks that played the Durban Test  Rabada and PlayeroftheMatch Marco Jansen  are fit for the second Test and Dane Paterson is the other quick in the squad However Nandre Burger is out for the summer with a lower back stress fracture while Lungi Ngidi is out till January.South Africa will play Sri Lanka in the second Test at St Georges Park between December 5 and 9 After that they will host Pakistan for three T20Is three ODIs and two Tests.

Australia Percent 5769 matches remaining Ind 4 home Tests SL 2 away The defeat in Perth means Australia have plenty to do to finish in the top two without depending on other results Given that South Africa and Sri Lanka can both finish on more than 61 Australia need four wins and a draw in their last six to finish ahead of Sri Lankas maximum of 6154 in this case only South Africa with a maximum of 6944 could finish ahead of them. If India were to win the ongoing series 32 Australia could still finish ahead of them but only if they sweep the away series against Sri Lanka 20 In this case Australia would finish on 6053 marginally ahead of Indias 5877 In that case they would surely finish in the top two as only South Africa could go past that Pakistan Percent 3333 series remaining SA 2 away WI 2 home Pakistans home form has shown some revival but its most likely too late in this cycle If they win each of their four remaining Tests they would finish on 5238 In such a case they would still need several results going their way to be in contention If for instance Sri Lanka lose 01 in South Africa and draw 11 against Australia India lose 12 in Australia and New Zealand lose 12 versus England then Pakistans 5238 would be enough for a second place behind Australia England Percent 4375 matches remaining NZ 2 away Englands win in Christchurch has marginally improved their percentage to 4375 Its almost certain that it wont be enough for qualification though theres a mathematical chance of finishing second on 4886 if several other results go their way if India lose all their remaining games and if South Africa and Sri Lanka get no more than six and 16 points respectively from their last three Tests then England could still finish second to Australia",

      "description": "Tom Latham New Zealands Test captain dismissed the notion that his team need to work on their catching after a litany of errors contributed to a chastening eightwicket defeat in the first Test against England.The hosts dropped a staggering eight catches in the tourists first innings with Harry Brook the lucky recipient of five of them on his way to a crucial 171.The lives allowed England to emerge from the first innings of the match with a 151 lead They were able to cash in on day four chasing down a mode Players on both sides struggled to see the ball clearly at the Hagley Oval particularly with the grass banks as packed as they were across all four days But Latham refused to use that as an excuse for their disappointing display in the field.I dont think its something that requires work said the skipper who was guilty of shelling Ben Duckett on 23 who went on to make 46 and Brook on 41 on day two.We certainly put the work in behind the scenes training days that sort of thing It certainly hasnt been a continuous thing thats been happening Its just one of those games  sometimes when one goes down they all keep falling We like to stay nice and level and try not to overemphasise things.Sometimes some grounds have different challenges with different backgrounds From our point of view were not looking for excuses.We know we need to be better and well hopefully do that in Wellington.Chris Woakes had Tom Blundell first ball New Zealand vs England 1st Mens Test 3rd day Christchurch November 30 2024. Tom Blundell had another poor outing but Tom Latham gave him his backingAssociated Press. It was a broadly untidy performance from the Black Caps Having been put in to bat after Ben Stokes won the toss they reached 199 for 3 before falling to 348 all out But for Kane Williamsons 93 and 58 from Glenn Phillips it could have been worse Then came the catching issues which in turn allowed England to rebuild their first innings from 45 for 3 then 71 for 4 Latham ceded the team have plenty to tidy up ahead of Fridays second Test at the Basin Reserve But he feels the margin of Englands victory wrapped up inside four days did not reflect a gap in quality between the two sides.To have them 70 for 4 with our tails up if we take some catches  certainly myself included  things might look slightly differently Latham said.Even though the result of the game does look quite big there are small margins in a game of cricket and unfortunately things didnt quite fall the right way By no means of not trying  boys are putting the effort in and some days thats just cricket  its the game we play  unfortunately things like that happen.Latham also backed Tom Blundell to find form reiterating his belief the 34yearold is the best option as keeperbatter Scores of 17 and a firstball duck continues a dismal 2024 for Blundell who is currently averaging 1588 from ten matches Will Young having been dropped for the returning illiamson despite his player of the series display during the 30 victory in India could come in to bolster the batting Who that is for remains to be seen.Devon Conway  who is also struggling with an average of 2343 this year  and Latham himself could take the gloves paving the way to reintroduce Young for Blundell Latham however has backed his regular gloveman to come good.I certainly believe Tom is our best wicketkeeperbatsman in the country And we certainly have the belief to give him the backing to play his natural game.Youre one innings away from being back in form Hes putting in the work behind the scenes as much as anyone We certainly know for him the results are not far away",
